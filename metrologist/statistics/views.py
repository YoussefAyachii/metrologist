Compute and save statistic outputs into static/img
Functions are provided by functions.py on the same dir.

Here we limit our program to extract cv_values of a given
microscope id from Cv table and show results as barplot. 

Note: As statistic figures are of temporary use, we will not consider
saving them into database. We consider them as temporary files.
